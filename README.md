# Tale of Tumbleweed
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021

## Theme
The phrase "Pick Your Poison" immediately brought the images of alcohol and the old wild west in addition to the idea of hard choices where no option is particularly good. So we used that as our basis, going for a wild-west aesthetic set in a saloon where the player has to make a choose between two unfavorable choices; Which gang gets to rule the town of Tumbleweed.

## Game Play
Talk to the members of the Rojos and Sentenzas gang and decide which one to aide in taking control of the town of Tumbleweed.

Gameplay instructions:
Use WASD to move the player, Press E to talk to an NPC if they have an ! over their heads, and choose which gang leader to kill in the menu by pressing 'escape'. Talk to all gang members in the bar, listening to their stories. Once you decide which gang you wish to side with, just kill the leader of the opposing gang. The game has two endings based on your decision.

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
- Initially we had actually planned to try the fighting game but didn't think it fit the prompt so we ended up scrapping it and starting over.
- Doing the sprites was a bit of a struggle as photoshop was uncooperative at the small 32x32 scale of the sprites.
- Sizing of the sprite sheet proved to be finicky.
- Coding the interactions between PC and NPC and switching to dialogue created a series of unexpected bugs.
- Then of course the limited time frame that caused us to cut some ideas like having detailed NPC portraits, a second location, dialogue trees, etc.
- The tweaking of the music was somewhat difficult as the guitar strums couldn't be too fast or too slow and only had about 20bpm where it would sound fine.
- Making the final choice also turned out to be a bit difficult so we had to make based on a choice in the in-game menu.

## Implementation
Features:
- Single top down map of the Tumbleweed Saloon
- Player can move around the map freely and talk to NPCs
- Player can choose which gang to side with
- 2 unique endings
