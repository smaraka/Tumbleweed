# Tale of Tumbleweed
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021

## Theme
The phrase "Pick Your Poison" immediately brought the images of alcohol and the old wild west in addition to the idea of hard choices where no option is particularly good. So we used that as our basis, going for a wild-west aesthetic set in a saloon where the player has to make a choose between two unfavorable choices; Which gang gets to rule the town of Tumbleweed.

## Game Play
Talk to the members of the Rojos and Sentenzas gang and decide which one to aide in taking control of the town of Tumbleweed.

Gameplay instructions.

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
- Initially we had actually planned to try the fighting game but didn't think it fit the prompt so we ended up scrapping it and starting over.
- Doing the sprites was a bit of a struggle as photoshop was uncooperative at the small 32x32 scale of the sprites.
- Sizing of the sprite sheet proved to be finicky.
- Coding the interactions between PC and NPC and switching to dialogue created a series of unexpected bugs.
- Then of course the limited time frame that caused us to cut some ideas like having detailed NPC portraits, a second location, dialgoue trees, etc.

## Implementation
Featues:
- Single top down map of the Tumbleweed Saloon
- Player can move around the map freely and talk to NPCs
- Player can choose which gang to side with
