Just the place a gun for hire such as yourself would feel comfortable in. There is a war at the heart of Tumbleweed, between the Sentenzas and the Rojos. Which side will you choose? Your choice will decide the future of this piece of dirt and the people that live on it. Listen wisely, and follow your heart. There is no right answer."
