			"text": "So, the Sentenzas offer you their money yet? Well, if you decide to side with them, just know that you won’t get to live long enough to see that cash buddy. I made quick work of the last 2 hired guns they got, and the many mercenaries hired by the many families that came before the Sentenza pigs. I burned their houses, stole their horses, killed their men. All for my family. I fight for a righteous cause, and they fight for money. That’s what gives me my edge. Unless you wish to find the lengths I’ll go to protect my family’s legacy, I suggest you side with us for this little war that’s going to break soon."
