We were foolish thinking that this would be a good\n opportunity to make money. Before we came here, our wealth and popularity in the state was growing. I believe the governor and his family wanted us out of the political picture, they sent us here on some suicide mission. We’re never getting out of this place with profits. You know what they say, when is a gift not a gift… But if you were to help us, we could at least make it out with little damage. You would be compensated very well for it too."
