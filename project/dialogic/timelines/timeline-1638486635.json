They burned our farmstead, stole our horses and killed the men we hired. Men of your profession. My mother may have came off as a little brutal, but she isn’t unreasonable. We tried to strike a bargain with the Rojos, they just wouldn’t listen. They kept shooting down our offers and harassing our homestead. My pride won’t let me take any more of this. We will fight back. With or without you stranger."
